## About Magpie

**Magpie** is a local-first, privacy-respecting **lightweight information hub** for Windows, built on a fast clipboard core.

It started as a clipboard manager and is gradually growing into a quiet place where the fragments you copy, sync, tag, and revisit all flow together. Capturing text and images is just the entry point — Magpie keeps your scattered bits organized and within reach, so the right snippet is always one shortcut away.

This repository is based on [`jimuzhe/tiez-clipboard`](https://github.com/jimuzhe/tiez-clipboard) under the GPL-3.0 license, and has been independently maintained as **Magpie** since v0.4.0. It includes upstream-pending bug fixes, privacy hardening, and UX improvements. See [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) for details.

> The magpie is folklorically associated with collecting shiny things — a fitting metaphor for an information hub that quietly keeps the bits and pieces you'll want later.

## Theme Gallery

  <sub>Note: the screenshots below are placeholders for the new Magpie v0.4.x theme captures (no more TieZ title bar). The image files will be swapped in once the new screenshots are taken; the visual styles (Mica, Acrylic, sticky note, etc.) are already what ships in Magpie.</sub>

## Known Limitations

### Win+V cannot be used as the main hotkey

`Win+V` is reserved by Windows for the built-in Clipboard History feature. Selecting `Win+V` in **Settings → Main Hotkey** will show "hotkey unavailable".

**Workaround**: pick `Alt+V`, `Ctrl+Shift+V`, `` Alt+` `` or any other combination — the experience is otherwise identical.

A proper fix is scheduled for v0.4.1: when `Win+V` is chosen, Magpie will offer to take over the hotkey via the `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced\DisabledHotkeys` registry value, with a clear opt-in switch in the settings panel. See [v0.4.1 plan](./docs/v0.4.1-plan.md) for details.

## Upgrading from TieZ

If you previously used `jimuzhe/tiez-clipboard` or this repository under the `TieZ` name, installing Magpie v0.4.0 will automatically migrate your data on first launch:
- Old data folder `%APPDATA%\com.tiez\` is copied into the new folder `%APPDATA%\app.magpie\`
- The old folder is kept as a safety net; you may delete it manually once you've confirmed the new build works for you
- The autostart registry entry is migrated from `TieZ` to `Magpie`; old entries are cleaned up
